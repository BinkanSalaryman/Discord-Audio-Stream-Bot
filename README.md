## Getting started
* Create an application with a bot user [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications). In the bot tab, copy the bot token and enable the "SERVER MEMBERS INTENT" (required to check if a user issuing a command has sufficient permissions)
* Run the bot program using **run win64.bat** or **run win32.bat** (depending on your PC's architecture; in case one doesn't work, please try the other one!)
* In the settings tab, paste your bot token
* In the home tab, click the big on/off button to log in to the bot user
* In the maintenance tab, invite/add the bot to a guild/server, if necessary
* Now you can enter commands - either by sending a direct message to the bot user, or @mention from within a channel of one of your guilds/servers. To get started, you can enter the command "help" for a list of available commands, and "help some_command_name_here" for specific information about a command. (Some hints: With the command "prefix" you can give it a short prefix to issue commands instead of the possibly lengthy @mention construct, and with the command "bind" you can restrict issuing of commands to one or more channels)
* Issue the command "join" to bring the bot user up in a voice channel
* In the settings tab, enable "speaking" and select a recording device (default one being your microphone, most likely)
* Now it should be sending audio from the selected recording device to discord.

### macOS

#### Building

* Install homebrew if you do not already have it, then:
  * `brew install gradle`
  * `gradle build`

#### Usage

* Follow the build steps above, then:
  * `cd build/distributions`

  * `DISCORD_AUDIO_STREAM_BOT_OPTS='-Djava.library.path="/usr/lib:../../../natives/mac/"' ./bin/Discord-Audio-Stream-Bot`

* Create a discord application w/ a bot user:
  * https://discordapp.com/developers/applications
    * In the bot tab, copy the bot token and enable the `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`
      * This is required to check if a user issuing a command has sufficient permissions.

  * Add token to `Settings - General - Bot Token`
  * Check `Speaking Enabled` and pick `Recording Device`
    * [Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) is a very good virtual audio cable application for macOS
